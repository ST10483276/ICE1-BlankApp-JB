## ICE1- BlankApp -JB

## First time experience

During my setup of Visual Studio, i was a bit overwhemled with the app experience and the new langauge that we are using in MAST5112 called TypeScript. after i did a few examples in class, i slowly started to understand how Visual Studio works and did a few projects and learned how to make an app with the basics that my lecturer Jessel Sookha taught in class. once i got used to Visual Studio Code, i starterd to play around with the code like changing the font size, changing the background and placing the text in differnt areas of the page. while doing this activity i learned about extensions as a extra add on for myself and what features they can do, i installed some add on's like code spell checker which checks your spelling on each line and corrects my spelling in order for the app to run.another problem that i encountered after completing everything was how i should push the project via github but in the end i manged to learn it by myself by using the terminal.
